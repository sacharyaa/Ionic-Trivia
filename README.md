### Todo ###
~Fix some decoding issues~

>If you see something like this --> `&quot;` I believe it's a server-side issue(php decoding), which I have no control over. Feel free to use replace() to fix faulted values but I will leave the codebase as it is, in case if someone wants to hook a different API
